## üöÄ Usage

### Configuring the Webhook

To initialize the webhook module, configure it with your Discord webhook URL:

```java
DiscordWebhookLogger logger = new DiscordWebhookLogger("https://discord.com/api/webhooks/your-webhook-url");
```

---

### Sending Crash Reports

Integrate the logger into your `UncaughtExceptionHandler` to automatically send crash reports:

```java
Thread.setDefaultUncaughtExceptionHandler((thread, throwable) -> {
    String errorReport = Log.getStackTraceString(throwable);
    logger.sendErrorReport("App Crashed!", errorReport);
    System.exit(1);
});
```

This ensures that any unhandled exceptions trigger an immediate webhook notification.

---

### Customizing Payload Data

You can modify the payload before sending it to include additional debugging information:

```java
logger.setUsername("Crash Bot");
logger.setAvatarUrl("https://your-avatar-url.com/image.png");
logger.addField("Device Model", Build.MODEL);
logger.addField("OS Version", Build.VERSION.RELEASE);
```
